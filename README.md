What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  In these projects, I was to design a system to intake a file and load that into a data structure to be used in whatever way needed. In project one, this focused on planning by writing pseudocode and examining different types of data structures. Project 2 involved coding this system and implementing a working menu.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I took the problem slowly and one step and a time. This allowed me to really get to know what I was trying to accomplish and figure out the best path forward. Data strctures are important because they could determine how fast or slow a program runs. Depending on how much data you have and the structure you choose, the efficiency of the code could be affected.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  Project 1 did not give me any issues, but project 2 I ran into a few. I overcame this by reaching out to the 24/7 Tutoring SNHU provides to get a different perspective on what I was trying to accomplish. This allowed me to open my mind to different methods to achieve different things and they even helped me simplify my code to make it run faster.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I have been able to see multiple ways to get the same objective done. This made me expand the possibilites of what is possible.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  When it comes to coding, I am very meticulous about how it looks, especially on the user side. I try to made my code as portable as possible and use functions to pinpoint the problem eaiser. This is something I try to do to the best of my ability, but I also know that there are always better ways out there to do that, that I haven't found yet.
